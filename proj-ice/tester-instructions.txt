You should test your program with this "tester" when you think that some
commands are already completed. Also, when asking for teachers help, the
output of this tester can help to identify your problems.

Unzip 'proj-ice2023-24-tester.zip', extracting everything to the same place as your project.
The file 'test_proj.py' and directory 'tests' should be placed in the same
directory (folder) as 'proj_ice.py'.

To run, just execute test_proj.py as you usually run your Python programs. If
in Spyder, open test_proj.py and run it by pressing the green arrow. This
program will execute your proj_ice.py with several commands specified by the
files in the tests directory and compare with the expected outputs. If the
output is the same for one test, that test it shown as passed, if not, the
output differences are shown, line by line.
